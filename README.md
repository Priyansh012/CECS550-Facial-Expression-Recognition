# CECS550-Facial-Expression-Recognition

This is a Pattern Recognition Mini Project that contains three notebooks implementing facial expression recognition using different deep learning models.

## [CNN_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb](CNN_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb)

This notebook implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial expression recognition. It includes code for downloading and extracting data, preprocessing images, and training the CNN model. You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Priyansh012/CECS550-Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/main/CNN_BASED_Facial_Expression.ipynb).

## [MobileNet_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb](MobileNet_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb)

This notebook uses the MobileNet model, a pre-trained deep learning model, for facial expression recognition. It includes code for downloading and extracting data, preprocessing images, and fine-tuning the MobileNet model. You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Priyansh012/CECS550-Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/main/MobileNet_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb).

## [VGG19_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb](VGG19_Based_Facial_Expression.ipynb)

This notebook uses the VGG19 model for facial expression recognition. It includes similar code to the previous notebooks but may contain different parameters or additional steps. You can run this notebook directly in Google Colab by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Priyansh012/CECS550-Facial-Expression-Recognition/blob/main/Facial_Expression_Recognition_Using_VGG19.ipynb).

## Data

The data used in these notebooks is downloaded from a URL specified in the code. The data is then extracted and loaded into the model for training.

## Dependencies

These notebooks depend on several Python packages, including TensorFlow for the deep learning models, pandas for data manipulation, and various others for downloading and extracting data.
